# Pull Request Monitor

## Description

I wrote this utility for myself. It uses GitHub CLI to monitor an open pull request and display the status.

## Usage

- Ensure dependencies are installed:
  - Go
  - GitHub CLI
- Sign in with GitHub CLI.
- Ensure the current branch has an open pull request.
- Run `go run main.go`
